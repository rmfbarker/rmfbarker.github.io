I'm currently reading 'Antifragile' by Nassim Taleb, a book that I have so far found an enthralling read. Taleb studies the properties of systems that he sees as having the trait of antifragility. Systems or things that are antifragile are those which become stronger when subjected to disorder or randomness.


After describing why the trait of antifragility is desirable Taleb goes on to discuss how we can make our institutions antifragile. One example he gives is the selection of the cabinet in a government. It is usual in most countries that the elected president or prime-minister selects her cabinet. Taleb suggests that these positions should be randomly allocated and only held for a short period before being reassigned, thereby removing the incentive for people/politicians to form entrenched factions to advance their own interests. By ensuring constant small changes to the cabinet the government becomes less fragile because it is constantly evolving and therefore less prone to a radical or large change in government.
